"Great phone, although I miss the integrated features that the iPhone provides. Excellent battery. However, the camera is slow and out of focus.",12-Aug-23,Amazon,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
The camera slows and out of focus and the whole phone itself seems slow. I had a Samsung Note before it was fast and was great for pictures which is the biggest reason I bought this note. If it wasn't for this defect it would have been a perfect 5 stars. (3.8/5),12-Aug-23,Amazon,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
Love the phone but the camera is soooo bad. :(,12-Aug-23,Facebook,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"I have had this phone for a little over a month now and am extremely happy with it. I love everything about it EXCEPT the Visual Voicemail Update that WONT GO AWAY. I DO NOT want Visual Voicemail and besides that, Verizon wants to charge 2.99 a month for it!! I won't go into this any further as it will just spark more rants about unwanted software/bloat ware. The problem with this particular piece of crapware is that notifications CONTINUALLY pop up and sit in the notifications bar at the top of the phone. If you clear it, it comes back, and there is no way to turn it off either! This is the reason for taking off 1 star off the phone¡¦s rating. Other than that, the phone is a real performer, takes wonderful pictures and video and is still slim enough to fit nicely in my back pocket. The phone is big, but so are my hands and it could not fit them better. This is truly a ¡§where have you been all my life¡¨ moment having this phone. The larger display is just awesome and the pen works great too. This phone would be a perfect 10+ without the software/bloat ware thing. But hey, where would the world be without annoying salespeople trying to sell you what you don¡¦t want or need? Anyway, the battery life has been great for me. Most times I can go 2 days without a charge. I do turn my phone off at night though and I don¡¦t play games on it with the exception of Bubble Shootº. I went from the Droid Razr Maxx to this phone and I loved that phone, well I thought I did until I got this phone. I was hesitant going away from Motorola equipment, as I have always had some sort of Motorola device because they are made so well. REALLY glad I made this switch!!",12-Aug-23,Amazon,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"Great phone, although I miss the integrated features that the iPhone provides. Excellent battery. I haven't found aftermarket apps, but in my transition i've noticed: What I do love: Great screen size to read everything comfortably, watch video clips, and appreciate pictures. Great battery life. I had to charge the iPhone I had twice a day. This I abuse and it still gets me through the day. It also has a removable battery for instant juice. Family I have in the Philippines have had to charge theirs 3-4 times a day due to the network infrastructure. Responsive In my transition, things I have noticed: -Native list syncing is not present. I decided to go with Wunderlist. I would have used Google Task, but it's not developed yet. -No button that pulls up voice command like Siri does in the lock screen. The voice command is not universal and not as easily accessible like Siri was. You can have it activate in the lock screen with a double tap of the home button, but it doesn't work if the phone is unlocked. If it is unlocked, you have to find the app. There is a buttonless voice activation (""Hi Galaxy""), but it stops working sometimes. -Google maps will persist in lock mode, but only if you don't hit the home button to summon the unlock screen. When you do that, the map disappears and you must unlock the phone to see it again (the iPhone will always show the map when navigating while locked, which was really nice). -Some apps tend to freeze. I simply hold down the home button and swipe to close a running program and then reopen it. -The text size kept changing on me every time I tried to text. I found you change the default text size with the volume buttons. -I had to be creative to migrate my contacts. I moved everything to Google from my iPhone, then synced with my phone. One thing that is great is that I can manage my contacts now through Google Contacts through my Gmail (they have a tool to remove duplicate contacts! -Text to speech engine is awesome, better than Siri in accuracy and speed, I think. -Camera and playlist controls aren't available in the lock screen as they were with the iPhone, UNLESS you disable security. I've used the pen when in phone calls to jot down and auto-call the numbers I write afterwards, which is really nice. After the novelty of the pen, I reverted to using the on-screen keyboard. I still use it on occasion. I like the availability, especially when sending information to people or writing on maps. I have used the S-Note notebooks to draw guitar chords and strumming patterns, so that's really nice. I just wish there was more integration, so I can see my notebooks on my computer. For a case, I used the Otterbox Commuter, which works well. It has no belt clip, but I would imagine I'd get tired of putting on the clip after a while anyway. This just slides into my pocket. Did I enjoy my iPhone? yes. simple, works, well integrated, robust, although sometimes non-responsive and poor battery life. Do I enjoy the Galaxy Note? yes. Totally different experience with the larger screen, great battery life, more enjoyment of pictures, video. It's not as well integrated, but it works and does what I want. In a mobile computing device/phone that I have on me all the time the screen, snappiness, battery life, and pen bring really make it and are much more important in the experience. Will I stay? I think so. I will learn the phone soon enough. The experience is just different. If you have any comments, please do! I'm still learning the phone. It is a great piece of art and master craftsmanship from Samsung. It comes from South Korea, a powerhouse of cutting edge technology and force in the global economy (I was there for a year and can appreciate the history). Not to be confused with China or Japan",12-Aug-23,Facebook,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"This is definitely the best phone I've owned. My previous were the Samsung Fascinate (Galaxy 1) and then the Galaxy S3. I have always prefered Samsung devices. I like Apples hardware but I hate iOS, so I stick to android devices. After working several jobs selling cell phones, and working with them all the time I always choose to buy samsung. I just think the Galaxy series phones have been really good. Well, the time came for my S3 to upgrade and I was planning on getting the newest ""S"" phone which at the time was the S5. After playing around with one for a bit I just wasn't crazy about it. It seemed bigger than my S3 by a noticeable amount, and had some annoying features that were unable to be turned off. I didn't care about the S Health or anything like that. I care about speed, and features. Thats where the Note shines. It is a large phone, but its actually not that much bigger than an S5. An S5 with an otterbox is bigger than my Note with a slim grip case. I have now had the phone for a couple months and pocketing it is no big deal at all. Also the Note has awesome features. S-Window is really cool, as well as Scrapbooker. S-note is useful for reminders or jotting down a number or something really quick. S-draw is really cool to use. The pen even comes in handy for texting and normal web use. Its screen is also really nice not quite 1080p but its 720p. It looks just fine I watch videos on it all the time. all in all I highly recommend the Note 3. The Note 4 hardware and build quality/materials are better. Its more expensive and has some slightly annoying features though. Consider a Note as your next phone over a Galaxy S. Not to m",12-Aug-23,Best Buy,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"I don't use a cell phone a lot, but I love the functionality of this phone. It is more like a mini tablet. The pen that comes with it is very handy, and activates the phone when you pull it out. It is also great for more precise selections and for note taking. I am very happy with the resolution of the screen and the response of both touch and pen. Buying the phone from Amazon and setting up a new Verizon account was painless. I easily got the account and on-line payment set up without a hitch. I also transferred my AT&T phone number to the phone without any problems. I won't reiterate the tech specs of the phone as you can read all of that on the product page. I just want to let you know what I think of it as a user of the phone. At this point in time, I couldn't be happier with this phone or the Verizon service. UPDATE 5/07/16 I've had this phone for a little over 3 years, and I still have no desire to get a new phone. I did, however, recently decide to switch my service provider from Verizon to T-Mobile because of the offerings of T-Mobile which I won't get into. I was assured by the T-Mobile rep that as long as the phone was unlocked, I could replace the Verizon sim card with the one from T-Mobile and the phone would work with no problems after activating the T-Mobile sim card. I am updating this review so that others don't experience what I did if they want to change their provider. First of all, Verizon has never locked any of their 4G phones. Verizon uses a CDMA network which is also used by Sprint and US Cellular, T-Mobile and AT&S use a GSM network. One difference is the polarity used, so phone for each type of network are manufactured to use the specific polarity of the network. The other difference that should be considered by the end user is that on the GSM network customer information is stored on the sim card. This means that you can take the sim card from one phone and insert it into another and it will work.GSM carriers must accept any GSM phone. So they don't have control over the phone you are using. CDMA carriers use network based white lists. So you can only switch phones with your carrier's permission, and the carrier doesn't have to accept any particular phone. There are other differences between the two network types, but those I have mentioned affect the end user the most. In my case, I had to buy a new phone in order to switch to T-Mobile as a carrier. I was also told by Verizon that this phone ""may"" work with another CDMA carrier, but it my lose functionality. I have had to buy another phone to use the GSM network, and have decided to get the Galaxy Note 4 since I have to give up my Note 3. I hope this helps other in choosing a carrier and a phone.",12-Aug-23,Facebook,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"best phone I've had so far. switched from AT&T to Verizon with this phone, and glad I did, customer service has been excellent. there were problems with overheating and the battery draining quickly - which you can see via an internet search - Verizon replaced the phone, but I found that the problem really seems tied to Google updating/syncing photos and videos - once I turned that off (and only do it on demand and when plugged in) the problem seems solved. have not been thrilled by the Note feature, but that is probably just my ignorance. Excellent camera, and I love the Google voice search/response feature (of course, that's an android, not just the Note 3). I am fairly careful with my phones, so haven't put a screensaver on it, nor do I use a case (most of the time) due to the weight - and find the phone and screen to be pretty durable, it still looks like new after about 2 years. it's large, and rather unwieldy, but for my old eyes, ability to see things on the screen makes up for it! it is slim and light enough to not be a problem. the sound is really good too, I almost always use the speakerphone on it for making calls, and like the sound when I play music or listen to audio books (and I'm fussy!). I haven't tried other brands, so can't comment on how the note 3 compares, tho I did look at them in the store before settling on this phone",12-Aug-23,Best Buy,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"Quick reference review: (details below) Fantastic all around! beautifully crisp screen in full HD, very quick response time for all around performance from texts to apps to games. Battery life is astounding, average users will have no problem going throughout a day on one battery, or even two. Connection on Verizon is fast, for both Data and Calls. I haven't experience any call quality issues. Camera qualities are second to none. The S-pen is a nice feature to have. Phone layout/buttons is easy to get used too. I can use this phone easily with one hand, but I have big hands in general. If your only issue with this phone is its size, GET IT. You easily get used to the size and don't even notice it (however i wouldnt recommend to individuals with tiny hands). Comment with any other questions ill try to get back as quick as I can. Bought this phone off amazon in january (2 months ago) due to its amazing deal and reduced price and I am not at all dissatisfied. Worth noting, I purchased this phone over the LG G2. I do have a single significant complaint on this phone regarding the charger, scroll to the bottom for that. Design: The layout and physical features of this phone are fantastic. While it may not be encased in a solid block of metal, you never feel like your holding a cheap phone. The materials are very sturdy and well made, especially when one utilizes a case. In my opinion, being able to access the battery, sim, microSD in the back of the phone is more useful than it being in a solid metal body. The phone itself is incredibly thin. I purchased a Spigen slim hardcase for the phone because I wanted to keep the phone sleek and thin as designed. Button placement is very intuitive and easy to get used too. Hardware: This phone is fast. All the benchmark tests do not lie. This thing performs better than any phone i've had and is faster than my 1st gen Samsung Galaxy Tab. I like to get the most out of my phones, to the point of unlocking them, but even with all of the pre-loaded bloat-apps this thing still flys. Great on WiFi or LTE. Screen is amazingly clear, with great contrast and color. Buttons are firm and don't feel like they're going to break. The speakers are good, not great. They get the job done for most users watching youtube or listening to music occasionally. If you're a hardcore music lover and sound quality is a top priority, you may want to look elsewhere. Touch screen sensitivity is great out of the box. I've had no issues. UI and software: If you've ever used an andriod or samsung device before, you'll quickly find yourself comfortable with this phone. If you've never used it before, it is easy and very enjoyable. I always recommend it over iOS, But I don't have enough experience with Windows to sway you from it. But the User Interface is intuitive and for the most part can be understood by most. There are so many customization's. From different widgets, layouts, screens, you have so many options to satisfy the most eclectic or OCD personalities. Camera: So many phones have crazy camera features or settings, while the average user wont notice or use half of them. I will say, the picture quality and useful features on this phone can be handy. From action shots to selfies to posting your lunch to instragram this phone with suffice for most! I always say if you want to really take meaningful pictures, buy a DSLR! Size: The size of this phone always seems to be the sticky issue with people. As I mentioned before, if size is the only issue holding you back from this phone, JUST GET IT. 99% of your wont be disappointed, and will quickly get used to the phone. Depending on your size, it will be easier than others. The average male wouldn't have a problem with it in his pocket. For reference I am about 6 foot and average build with larger hands. I'm always amazed how often I don't even feel it. However, for smaller individuals it may be an issue. My honest opinion is find one in person. I went to BestBuy and the Samsung rep allowed me to hold his work Note3. I was able to get a real sense of size and feel of it in my pocket, and not just attached to a display table. I love having a larger screen, it just makes it that much easier to use and enjoy, and to me outweighs any size inconvenience. Battery Life: It's amazing. The big size means samsung is able to throw a big battery in it. So even though the larger screen uses more power, many average users wont have a problem going an entire day on one charge. on average i get about a day and a half. If i use heavy (constant screen on) for several hours straight, then i'll run the battery down in a day. But idle in your pocket with LTE on all day. You'll have no issues. The USB 3.0 charger/port is fantastic. This thing charges so fast. I can get a full charge in half the time as my old HTC Thunderbolt. People complain about the thickness of the cord, but its required for the phone to charge that fast, safely. Which brings me to my only issue i've had with this phone... My only complaint: I had a few issues charging my phone. At first I was extremely upset as I thought the port inside my phone was defective. Essentially, with the USB 3.0 cord and charger, you get 2 connections in one. The standard USB port, and an extra smaller port which is why your able to achieve such fast charging and data transfers. My issue was that one of the 2 connections on the USB3 wasn't getting a solid contact in my phone. This lead to longer charge times and my phone telling me ""Please use the original charger that came with your phone for faster charging"". I simply bought a new cord on amazon and i haven't had any problems since. I recommend to anyone having charging issues to first try another cord, as my issue was that the connection to the phone on the cord, was slightly bent. On the other side, its worth noting you CAN indeed charge this phone with regular phone micro USB cords, however it will be slow. Overall, JUST GET THIS PHONE. I can't state it enough, it is really a fantastic phone. I fought back and forth whether to get this or the LG G2 for cheaper, but I decided I wanted the best phone I could buy (at ~$250 for the best phone on the market? that's fairly priced) and would last me a long time, and more importantly keep me preoccupied, and not wanting to buy a new phone before my upgrade.",12-Aug-23,Facebook,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"Love, Love, Love it!!!! This is my first smartphone and I love it. The first three days I was like... this thing is way to big, this isn't going to work. After that I got used to it and I can tell you, there is no way I can ever go back. The camera is fantastic. The picture quality on the screen is breathtaking. I have watched so many HD videos. It does allow for split screen and doing multiwork. For example I can split screen and have txt messages on one side and web browser on the other. I can also get on the internet and search something while talking on the phone with someone. And don't forget the stylus! I had some people tell me it was gimmicky but I really like it. When making notes and reminders its much easier than typing and I like to use it for alot of games as well since it is more precise than using my finger.",12-Aug-23,Best Buy,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"This is my first purchase of a cell phone from Amazon. The phone is beautiful and is just what I wanted. The price was right and the delivery time was excellent. The only issue I had was that I did not know that I needed to call Verizon first before it would activate. It seems like Amazon could mention that step when they sell a new phone. Even Verizon did not mention it in the accompanying paperwork that came with the phone. After several unsuccessful attempts to activate the phone, which is supposed to be automated, I went to the Verizon website and found a number I should call prior to letting the phone run the auto-setup and activate the phone. Other than that, I am thrilled with my purchase.",13-Aug-23,Amazon,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"When I ordered this item it was said to take about two to three weeks to come in. To my suprise it took only about 5 days for the item to arive. The quality of the product was exactly as posted 9 out of 10. Not a single scratch, dent, or blemish from my evaluation. Everything has worked perfectly from the time I opened it put of the box, and I received exactly why was promised. My girl friend wanted a phone that would be better than the generic $40.00 go phone that could be purchased for her carrier, and what we got was many folds greater. S pen was perfect. Phone was without a blemish. She literally can't stop taken pictures with this phone because Samsungs camers rock. The only down side that I would have to say is that the battery performance is quite poor, but that would be expected if it was the original battery that game with the phone on a older model. I plan on buying a battery for a good deal off amazon for this phone in new condition, which should fix all off her problems I rated this 5 stars to be nice, but in all reality I would give this a 4 out of 5 for the lack of battery porformance. Thanks for saving me money once again amazon. ^.^",13-Aug-23,Facebook,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"When I got this phone I LOVED it! It was awesome, big, fast, lasted all day, great camera, great reception! Then they ""upgraded"" my operating system to KitKat and that all changed! Ok, it's still big... KitKat turned my phone into a brick! I did not move, but I could no longer MAKE OR RECEIVE calls at home! Just got a ""Network Not Available"" message or something like that. My data signal was likewise in the toilet. Battery went to the potty, and the worst was the formerly awesome camera became practically useless because now when you tapped the shutter button, you had to wait about 3 seconds (no exaggeration) for the picture to take. If you moved, the picture was trash. This all started immediately following the KitKat update - google the problems, they're myriad. I wouldn't buy another one till the next software update comes out. Total brick, and total waste of my money. Thanks for nothing Verizon, or Samsung, or whoever's fault this is - because no matter who you call it's always the ""other's one"" fault...",13-Aug-23,Amazon,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"I didn't find the need to buy a smartphone until last December. I eschewed them. I had been using my dinosaur phone for the last three years. It could take abuse like no other. It might have required the battery pulled now and then to reset it, but it kept doing the job I hired it for, making calls. I always had a cheap company smartphone or my wife nearby with hers, so I didn't get one until I got this one. This phone is awesome. It's huge screen is perfect for emails, surfing the web, whatever. But that screen size comes with a price. This phone is huge. People will tease you about it. You can always show then how good of pictures it takes and how fast the shutter speed is.... Or any of the plethora of other features you'll like if you get this phone. Oh yeah, the battery lasts forever.",13-Aug-23,Amazon,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is a powerful personal pocket computer that you can also use as a phone as well. I bought this phone a year late and it is still miles beyond most of the phones out there. It's fast, smooth and the battery life is fantastic. If your a doodler like me the s-pen in combination with sketchbook for galaxy is top class when it comes to digital art applications. I would recommend downloading the Google Now launcher as opposed to using the standard Tocuhwiz that the phone comes with as it is a little clunky and if you have a Google account that you use frequently the launcher really makes the experience personalized and it's scary accurate. The only downside to this phone is speaker quality without headphones.",13-Aug-23,Facebook,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"Love, love, love this phone!!! Having the 32 GB makes a huge difference in the speed. I received the phone in a new Samsung box, with a OEM charger cable and plug. Very easy to use and see. Yes, it's a bit bulky but I bought a Bluetooth Earbud DABS AUDIO S10, Mini Wireless Headset for $25 prime and it works great. The S note feature is wonderful for snapping a picture of your screen and making notes. Or just to use as a note pad. Highly recommend!",13-Aug-23,Amazon,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"I am slow to enter the 21st century. This is my first smart phone. I only paid a penny, and I'm very happy with it. It's fairly easy to use. My kids LOVE playing with the pen, drawing on photos, etc. The service is great. The colors are beautiful! I am definitely not an apple fan, but I do like Siri better than the S voice. She works better, and all my friends say the voice on my phone is creepy - seductive sounding. I got my brother to change the voice. He's good with technology, and it still took him a while, but it's better.",13-Aug-23,Facebook,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"My husband just purchased this as a replacement for his Galaxy Nexus. He is thrilled with it. He loves the multi-tasking abilities, the vibrant screen, and the extra-long battery life. While at first it seems a lot larger than other phones, my husband has adapted to it and wouldn't want the screen to be any smaller. The only time that the size is a nuisance, is when he tries to carry in his front pocket. The phone is extremely fast and efficient. He didn't think that he would use the S Pen but he loves it and uses it all the time. This phone is like having your own personal computer with you at all times - there's really nothing that it can't do.

"TOP DOG! IMO, best phone out there. Great for multitasking! excellent screen, fast!. lightweight. Camera takes great pictures in good lighting. S-Pen works great! speaker output nice and crisp. Battery life really good, if you turn off some un-needed functions like gestures, turn off GPS when your not needing it, turn off auto sync, and set screen time out to 30 sec.....I been getting easy 2 days without charging with light usage like streaming youtube, web browsing and some email. Call quality very good, can hear callers loud and sharp on Verizon network that is. 4G blazing fast on Verizon. Wifi antenna can be a little stronger.

"Over the years I've always had great phone's, however; I must say this is the BEST phone I have ever owned. I had taken four months to research all of the phones out there and am pleased that I settled on the 'Samsung Galaxy Note 3"". Many of my friends and family tried to talk me out of it, stating it was just to big, and it certainly does look big on display, but once you get it in your hand, it fits perfectly! Now that I own it, all of my friends and family want one! The look and feel of the phone is amazing! The size of the screen is awesome! I also love how you can 'hand write your text messages with your stylus pen, or you can hand write and have it automatically convert to a block style message or you can still use the keyboard if you like! I always hand write my text messages as I've never liked using a keyboard. I also love that I can jot down notes with my stylus pen, I use this feature a LOT for my work. The speakers sound GREAT - when listening to music, the mix of tones is crisp and clean while blending beautifully! I use my phone ALL of the time, and the battery life is AMAZING and especially compared to all of my previous phones! I can't say enough GOOD about this phone. I've owned it for a month now and still haven't even touched on all of the great features this phone has! I hope they come out with a Galaxy Note (4) in a few years because there is no doubt that will be my next phone! Thanks AMAZON! Your impeccable service is appreciated!!!!!",13-Aug-23,Amazon,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
I have ever used....I had the iphone 4S and have to say I did not think it was worth the price. This Samsung Galaxy Note 3 however is worth every penny. I'm not a techno genius and you don't need to be with this phone. The calls are clear...the display is vibrant and easy to see (love the larger screen)...it was actually the camera that sold me on this phone....but I am digging the S-pen and the other gadgets it has. While I will admit apple seems to have more apps this android has all the apps that I was using on my iphone. All in all I say it is the best phone even though the Galaxy S5 has hit the market.,13-Aug-23,Amazon,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"Great phone. I was considering to by the Sony phone, but I needed something cheaper. I am very satisfied with it. Very easy to use and I use many-many functions on it. The battery life is great too, unless I acidentally leave on the WiFi or use the GPS. These deplete my battery much faster. The only problem with this phone that it is impossible to change contacts, email or texting background dark or black. That's a little disturbing but if you can get over this it is a great device.",13-Aug-23,Facebook,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"I have quickly come to find the size of the screen to be far superior to my old S3. I would never go back to a smaller phone's screen. The Note 3 is very detailed, colors are vibrant and I see no pixels even when the image is magnified. I was a bot reluctant to buy a refurbished phone, but Breed sent a phone indistinguishable from new. Also, the accessories for an older model are FAR cheaper than the new Note 5. As for the Note 5, the lack of a removable battery and sd card were deal breakers for me.",13-Aug-23,Facebook,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"

This phone works great, I haven't had any major problems with it. The only problems I have had are typical phone problems like it freezing up on me; but after taking the battery out and turning it back on it is fine again and that hasn't even happened as often as other phones I've had.

Finally something that has my heart this is the best phone I have ever owned. I carry two and the other is an IPHONE. But hands down this phone does everything and I would never go back to any other kind. It is big enough for viewing and I love the touch enlarging. Battery lasts all day even with steady use.

"Big screen, long battery life, and powerful specs. What more could you ask for? This is the top of the line smart phone right now. Beware, I have had issues with the stock charging cable.It is USB 3.0, and is slightly larger that a normal USB 2.0 from most other phones. Plugging in the 3.0 charger will sometimes work, but mostly it doesn't You may have to use an old charger, but the battery is so big that it will take you a while to fully charge that way. Search for ""USB 3 cable not charging"" on andriod central to see others with the same problem.",14-Aug-23,Amazon,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"Nothing compares to this phone. Everything else is inferior. Everything else is too small, or too slow. The Note 3 is the finest device ever made, period. I can't imagine texting or browsing or watching on something smaller than this now that I've had it for a while. The camera takes great pics & video, very fast. I'm also quite happy with Verizon so far. Fast data downloads and much better call clarity & service in my area than other carriers I've tried.",14-Aug-23,Amazon,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"LOVE LOVE...Absolutely, love this phone!!. I am not crazy about Verizon. I received my first bill before I had the phone a week. Higher that I expected. I was charged an activation fee of an extra $45. The data really goes fast, but I have learned to use WI-FI. Still, Samsun outdid themselves with this phone. It has a glitch thing about touching the icons and the screen jumps to the next page. Still love the phone though. Waiting to see when the Note 5 comes out",14-Aug-23,Best Buy,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"I finally had to break down and purchase a new phone to replace the flip I had been using for about 10 years. I chose this because it was highly rated by all the reviews I read and I absolutely refused to be a moronic lemming and purchase an iPOS. The price through Amazon was better than what I could do through Verizon and the setup was absolutely painless. I am NOT too thrilled about the $50 increase in my monthly bill, but that's what you get for going from a no-frills flip phone to a ""phablet"".",14-Aug-23,Best Buy,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"Wish this phone would of worked as the screen quality and size are great. Sadly, Verizon says the phone is obsolete and no longer supported.",14-Aug-23,Best Buy,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"Fantastic, never had a Smartphone before, and it's nice to know that it is user friendly. Very much fun, and going to have a heck of a time figuring all the cool things out. I especially love the stylus since I hate using my fingers to work on a screen. I always feel like my fingers are going to smudge up the screen, so the stylus really helps me out with that. Not tried any of the apps yet, but I'm probably going to be doing a lot of exploring on it, as I said. Excellent phone, and tons of fun. Even my husband, who is through Tracfone, was considering on getting one through his provider. All my phones have been Samsungs, from the first phone which I cannot remember the name of, to my Samsung Intensity II, and now my Samsung Galaxy Note 3. I love it!",14-Aug-23,Amazon,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"It's an alright, solid phone. The pen is a great feature for drawing and editing photos. Though i honestly dont use it all that much. Its a little wide making it hard to put in a pocket or do one handed. This phone is however only slightly bigger than an S5. It has a good processor and is easy to use. The call quality however is crap. It sounds like your underwater. The camera is also poor and I have difficulty getting a sharp image.",14-Aug-23,Amazon,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"I wondered why GPS took me in circles. I went into Verizon, they said they quit supporting the Note 3. I had to get a new phone.",15-Aug-23,Best Buy,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"It is exactly as it was described. It works perfectly, with minor scratches. It came with all the necessary items to use for a day to day basis. The cell phone company had no issue of making this phone my primiary cell phone.",15-Aug-23,Best Buy,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"Does not have as many screens as my original note 3, which has 7 windows. This one only has 5",15-Aug-23,Best Buy,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"So far so good. Bought this to replace the Samsung Note II when upgrade eligibility came around. Note 2 screen cracks easily and I suspects that this ""gorilla"" glass will break easily too. Just make sure you have a protective case just in case you drop it. Functionality is great. Battery life is exceptional compare to Note 2 and Droid Razor. Pictures are exquisite compare to the Iphone according to several I Phone owners that saw my pictures.",15-Aug-23,Facebook,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"Phone works great but I would say the phone was in good condition if not a bit lower. There are a lot of chips on the chrome trim around the screen. The back leather part has a few scratches on the back, fading around the camera, and looks like fading all in the middle, it kind of looks like there is dust all over the back that wont come off. I will post pictures in a bit.",15-Aug-23,Facebook,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"Can't beat price and not even refurbished. Saved over 400.00 will buy next phone this eay. Only problem, my Verizon store was really not very interested in transferring photos and setting it up without them selling it to me. Main drawback.",15-Aug-23,Facebook,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"This phone works really great. It runs all the latest apps with no freezing or slowdowns. The screen is bright and very sharp. Both the front and rear cameras work well, and the flash doubles as a very bright flashlight. I've dropped it and sat on it and even dunked it in the swing pool. It still works flawlessly.",15-Aug-23,Facebook,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"Phone is everything previous reviews have noted. More phone than 90% of folks would ever use. One thing that has been a bit of a disappointment has been reception. As some have noted this phone for whatever reason on Verizon , reception is average. I am 2000 ft from my cell tower and have yet to see more than 4 mb down on 4g. When I am closer to other towers I have seen 39mb down on 4G so I know the product is capable. Mind you it is possible that this tower is saturated as I never saw more than 13 mb down on myDroid Razr Maxx. Voice reception has dropped off as well and at times fades out but returns in the same location. Never had that issue with the Razr. Here is hoping that software updates resolve some of it....... Other than that...amazing device",15-Aug-23,Amazon,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
Love my new Note 3! Great features...one being that I can actually see it! I was worried about moving away from my old smart phone with a slide out keyboard as I'm part of the...ahem...more mature crowd and my eyes & fingers aren't what they used to be. No problems whatsoever...I text like a pro on this!,15-Aug-23,Facebook,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
I traded to this from the iphone 5. It was the greatest change in my life. I love this phone i can go 20 hours easily even more. If you leave it in stand bye mode you can leave it for days. I just wish it had kitkat for verizon. I also wish there was a nice dock for it. Its awkward because of the usb 3.0. Its a different plug and if you use the old 2.0 connection it takes long to charge it,15-Aug-23,Amazon,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"I absolutely LOVED the phone and would have given it 4 or 5 stars ..... until .... I made the horrible and could be very dangerous mistake of ""upgrading"" the system per the prompts .... now many times I am unable to connect to the network, cannot make calls, cannot text, in other words the basic things you have a mobile phone for ARE USELESS. I sure hope I am not out late somewhere and stranded by the side of the road when this happens! Of course there is no way to undo the ""upgrade"" to the operating system, I am now stuck with this phone that way too often does not work AT ALL. Worse yet, from what I understand the manufacturer KNOWS this is an issue with this upgrade and yet they are offering no fix, no upgrade to this horrible upgrade. WHY? I guess they want everyone who made the mistake of approving the prompted upgrade to just buy a new phone! Maybe a Note 4? Anyway, if they cannot be bothered to fix what could be a dangerous situation (out late with no phone service) then I will purchase another phone from another manufacturer next time. Until then, because this was so expensive, I will just have to hope I am never in a life or death or emergency situation and have ""no network connection"".......!!!",15-Aug-23,Amazon,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
"I keep learning new things about this phone each time I use it. It has replaced all my TV remotes in my house. I no longer use my ipad because this can do even more than the ipad can. My wife has the iphone 5s and uses my phone every chance she gets. The Note 3 is so light, even with its screen size, that it easily disappears in a pocket. The only reason to buy the iphone 5s is because you have not tried a Note 3 yet.",15-Aug-23,Amazon,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
The camera slows and out of focus and the whole phone itself seems slow. I had a Samsung Note before it was fast and was great for pictures which is the biggest reason I bought this note. If it wasn't for this defect it would have been a perfect 5 stars. (3.8/5),15-Aug-23,Amazon,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB","camera, battery"
