"I've delayed quite a bit in writing my review trying out various different things. And also, because this is my first dash camera, I have no experience to compare it to.

I've been very happy with this purchase for the price. While I haven't even ever had so much as a fender bender in 33 years of driving of course we all have close calls and its' amazing how much less anxiety you have with bad drivers knowing you have video coverage.

The manual is good enough but unnecessary as the online menu options are self explanatory.

I was a little concerned at first with the extreme bending bubble on the outside of the video but guess this is normal and just shows to serve how wide of angle it captures.

I rarely drive at night but reviewed a recent video and it was pouring rain that night and I could still read traffic signs, on the front camera, in the video so I guess thumbs up! The rear was very limited though. :(

I've seen a number of reviews by people stating they don't like the wireless option but the higher quality they get the slower its' going to be. I bought a $10 Micro SD card reader and if I ever need to review video that's what I'll use.

The other theme with reviews is the customer service and I cannot say enough about how great this company's customer service is. Funny how that has been the biggest slippage with companies over the years but this is one of the best I have ever dealt with in my life. While asking a functionality question I jokingly mentioned I ejected the SD card too quickly and it flew across the room (I still have never found it...that sucker had trajectory) and was purchasing another and they immediately said they were shipping me a new SD card free of charge. WHAT!? Who does that these days? If you want great initial and continued support on a product I give them 6/5 stars.

My only negative experience was their player application. I don't find it very intuitive for certain things and when you view anything but non-HD that window retains focus and you have to drag the windows behind it to get back to the menu bars. But I've provided my feedback and sure they'll attend to it.

So I've been using it for 4 months now and the only issues have been with this guy. Already watching their newer offering and 100% will be going through RedTiger in the future when I upgrade in the future based on their customer service alone.",2023-10-14,Amazon,REDTIGER Dash Cam
"The dash-cam is very user friendly and exactly as described.
Other dash-cams with nearly same options are way too expensive compared to the high quality you receive with the Redtiger Dash-cam.
Also I have to mention that they have the best customer service, answers fast, strive for excellency, and delivers service that exceeds expectation.
I'll never hesitate to buy from this seller again.
Really I have never been satisfied with a product and their support as I am happy with Redtiger. And special thank you for Larina for the assist provided.",2023-11-28,Amazon,REDTIGER Dash Cam
"In a world where screenless app controlled cameras are dominating the market, this was a refreshing product to receive. The camera is really well designed. It comes with a 32gb memory card which was a pleasant surprise. I appreciate the suction cup mount rather than 3m. Overall I like it a lot better than my blackvue camera I have in my other vehicles. IÕve had aiofo, blackvue and thinkware cameras before and I think surprisingly this is my favourite out of all of them. IÕll be running Red tiger dash cams in my cars going forward.",2023-11-21,Bestbuy,REDTIGER Dash Cam
"I had it professionally (used hardwire kit for the rearview camera) and it has been working excellent for the two weeks I used so far. The front and back are clear day and night (and sometimes I'd have a better view of the back through the camera haha). The customer service was excellent as well, as they were quick to answer my questions and helpful when asking for additional help.
There are a few features on the camera, including the park motion detector, and the app has been working when I tested it, and I was able to download clips. The one inconvenience is that I'd need to hook up the camera to the socket in order for the camera to connect to the app.
Great value",2023-11-10,Amazon,REDTIGER Dash Cam
"Right off the bat, quality seemed quite good for the price. Worked when I first got it without an issue.
A month in with it now, I'm not too impressed. When I actually needed to save a clip from it, the app doesn't work.
Connected to camera wifi without issue, but the app will not recognize that there's a camera. Keep saying failed to detect camera, despite being connected to its wifi, and being a foot away from it. Cannot try and re-add the camera as a new one in the app either.
Kinda makes it useless. Don't want to have to pull the SD card and connect to a computer every time I need to save a clip, I would have bought a different camera if I wanted to do that.
Can't find anyway to contact the manufacturer either. Can't through Amazon, and the help page won't even load on the app.",2023-11-23,Bestbuy,REDTIGER Dash Cam
"A Misallocation of Resources - A Cautionary Review

Prospective buyers should exercise caution when considering a purchase based solely on reviews. My experience with this product has revealed discrepancies between the positive feedback and its actual performance. Unfortunately, the device's functionality is compromised. The screen frequently crashes, rendering it incapable of executing essential tasks. Additionally, the dash cam exhibits erratic behavior, abruptly ceasing video recording midway. Furthermore, the unit repeatedly powers on and off without any discernible cause.

Given these concerns, I advise against acquiring this product, as it may result in a waste of both financial resources and valuable time."," August 13, 2023",Amazon,REDTIGER Dash Cam
"There is a very common issue with this dashcam if you read all the negative views. Depending on your luck, your dashcam will only work for a week or a few months, then just die. This is a problem because if youre unlucky and your dashcam stops working after 30 days, you can no longer return it to Amazon. So the choice is yours... are you willing to gamble $250 or find another dashcam to buy.",04-Oct-23,Bestbuy,REDTIGER Dash Cam
This product is not what you think. For me it just work for two minutes and after it turns off all the time. I change settings and try to change all the settings but still having this problem. Most of the time it just shut down and record nothing.,01-Dec-23,Amazon,REDTIGER Dash Cam
"Good little camera but....the playback when using two cameras on the Andriod and PC is slow, choppy and very irritating. The only way it plays back fine is on the camera itself or if only one of the two cameras are used. Tried many things...faster memory card as they recommended, formatting the memory card, defaulting the camera, different power sources (12v outlet as well as the assossort kit)...no changes. Customer service is ok, you basically call and they walk you through the manual and if that doesn't work then you email back and forth and it takes 1 to 2 business days per reply (so if it's mutliple back and forth expect it to day days or weeks to sort out). They continued to work with me including asking for a sample video from the SD card (too large to email btw) and even replacing the power supply. So if you have time and patience to fiddle with something that should work out of the box...have at it. I returned it and went to a box store where the stuff does what it should, no questions. Good effort but the product is not good enough",31-Oct-22,Bestbuy,REDTIGER Dash Cam
"I'm an experienced techie, and had no real trouble getting this system neatly installed into wifey's Honda HRV. Took maybe an hour, not including testing. But non-techie impatient wifey would never have been able to figure it out. If she needs to access any recorded evidence, it will be a major challenge for her. One reason I chose this system was the GPS, to ensure accurate time stamps, which seems to work as expected. Wifey routinely speeds, according to the few video clips which I downloaded to my iPhone using the WiFi feature. Video quality is excellent, being limited primarily by reflections from the inside of the front windshield. The back camera video looks better because of fewer reflections from the inside of the rear window. I measured power consumption (with a special USB inline multimeter doohickey) to be about 5 watts while both front and rear cameras are recording. I purchased the extra parking monitoring power cable, but have not yet attempted installation of that. After a test drive, I was able to pull out the microSD memory chip and review videos on my home computer. The dashcam accurately recorded a small black cat madly dashing across the 4-lane street in the dark not far in front of us. And we saw 2 sports cars following us for miles thru the rear video, not willing to drive any faster than wifey. The video files are huge, taking about 3 megabytes per second for front and year combined. It takes a long time to transfer files by WiFi, maybe 20 seconds per minute of video. I am using a Sandisk MAX 128GB microSD card. I bought a USB3 microSD card adapter to transfer files into my PC. Overall, this product has met my expectations so far. I hope it endures summer heat, autumn damp, and winter chills.",07-Apr-23,Amazon,70mai Dash Cam
"I already had a dash cam, but it was difficult to use. This camera was easy to install, easy to set up, and relatively easy to access the footage. (you might need to be somewhat technically savvy to use the wifi option)
The picture is clear, and I have never had an issue with the SD card.",27-Oct-23,Amazon,70mai Dash Cam
"Great picture, small footprint. Reasonable to install, but do recommend watching YouTube videos on installing it if you are unfamiliar with how the edge of the roof along the window and dash have spare. Sorry, older lady here lol, with limited experience on installing anything on a vehicle. The only con, could have a longer cord for vehicles the 12v in the console not dash. It does fit and work but has no wiggle room, good that it wonÕt get caught. Still very pleased with purchase.",12-Oct-23,Bestbuy,70mai Dash Cam

"Speedy delivery, received the device within 24 hours. I bought this for my 2011 Totyota Camry Hybrid. Easy to install for the front camera, but cable is a tad short if I want to run under the carpet to the cigarette lighter in the centre console. So I need to route the cable under the steering wheel, where the OBD connector is located. Recommend to update the firmware before installation starts. The rear camera is tricky to install because I have to find an appropriate spot to hide the excessive cable length. The unit is easy to configure, relatively intuitive using the small 2"" display on the unit. I don't have enough experience to commend on the video quality.
I bought a second one for my wife's Honda CRV. Easy to install the front camera. The rear camera is a bit more tricky since it involves removing trim covers, fishing the wire and hidding the excessive cable length. Not an easy job for a consumer who has no experience in this area.",07-Aug-23,Amazon,70mai Dash Cam
I have never been so frustrated with a dash camera as I was with this one. It was connected and disconnected and connected and disconnected over and over. Randomly starts recording an Òemergency recordingÓ for no reason even when parked.,29-Nov-23,Bestbuy,70mai Dash Cam
I had replaced 4 NEW memory cards. The message saying memory cards damaged happened about 2-3 weeks frequently. No One can explain the reason.,19-Nov-23,Amazon,70mai Dash Cam
I format my sd cards several time and it still says I have to format it again. I would appreciate if you can help me because I bought the dash cam to record accidents but now itÕs not working and I had an accident already. Thanks,10-Sep-23,Bestbuy,70mai Dash Cam
